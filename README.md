# clojure.core in java

This code is not intended to be used. 

The goal is the get to know better how compiled clojure looks internally. 

This is not a 100% match of what the bytecode is doing, but its pretty close.

The code has been generated with clojure-objc(https://github.com/galdolber/clojure-objc) and contains the whole clojure core library.
